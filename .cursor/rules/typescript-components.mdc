# Component Development Rules

1. Base Component Patterns:
   - Use `React.forwardRef` for all base components
   - Include proper type definitions with ComponentPropsWithoutRef
   - Follow the naming convention: Base{ComponentName} for base components
   - Use `cn()` utility for className merging

2. Props Interface Rules:
   - Define interfaces with proper naming: {ComponentName}Props
   - Extend HTML element props when appropriate
   - Include optional className prop
   - Document complex props with JSDoc comments

3. Variant Handling:
   - Use class-variance-authority (cva) for component variants
   - Define variants in separate const above component
   - Export variant types if needed by other components

4. Component Organization:
   - Keep related components in same file if tightly coupled
   - Split into separate files if component grows beyond 100 lines
   - Export all variants and subcomponents from index file
