# Project Status Report

## Overview

This project is designed to be a rewards management and promotion system for the 14th Street Store, aimed at effectively tracking customer rewards, managing promotions and discounts, and enhancing customer engagement. It aims to deliver the following key functionalities:

- Rewards Processing and Tracking
- Promotion and Discount Management
- User Account and Transaction Integration

## Project Structure

- **docs/**: Project documentation (this file, further guides, and API documentation)
- **src/**: Main source code (core application logic, modules, and components)
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests
- **config/**: Environment and configuration files

## Current Development Status

- **Core Functionality:**  
  Critical modules such as the rewards management system and promotion engine have been implemented. User transaction handling and reward allocation workflows are operational, though enhancements in error handling, dynamic configuration, and performance optimization are planned.
- **Testing:**  
  Initial unit tests exist for core features, but broader coverage—including edge cases in transaction flows and promotion logic—is needed.
- **Documentation:**  
  Foundational documentation is in place, yet more detailed guides, API references, and onboarding instructions are required to assist new developers.
- **Code Quality:**  
  The code maintains consistent styling and modular design across key components; however, certain modules (notably within the promotions engine) would benefit from refactoring for improved readability and scalability.

## Key Areas & Roadmap

### Completed

- [x] Implemented core rewards management module handling user transactions and reward assignments.
- [x] Initial implementation of the promotion engine along with dynamic configuration management.
- [x] Established the foundational directory structure and environment configuration.

### In Progress / Planned

- [ ] **Feature Enhancements:** Introduce refined reward calculations and flexible promotional strategies to boost user experience.
- [ ] **Testing:** Broaden unit, integration, and performance tests with a focus on edge cases in rewards and promotions.
- [ ] **Documentation:** Expand technical guides, API references, and developer onboarding materials.
- [ ] **Performance Optimizations:** Profile and optimize performance-critical modules, particularly within the promotions engine.
- [ ] **UI & API Improvements:** Enhance interfaces and endpoints to support detailed reporting and real-time updates.

## Known Issues & Risks

- **Testing Gaps:** Inadequate test coverage, especially for edge-case scenarios in rewards and promotions, may conceal potential bugs.
- **Documentation Limitations:** Current documentation may not fully meet the needs of new contributors.
- **Performance Concerns:** Early performance assessments indicate that the promotions engine could face optimization challenges under high load.

## Next Steps

1. [ ] **Increase Test Coverage:** Develop comprehensive tests for rewards processing and integration flows, including edge-case scenarios.
2. [ ] **Optimize and Refactor:** Refine and optimize performance-critical modules, with a focus on the promotions engine.
3. [ ] **Expand Documentation:** Create detailed guides, API references, and onboarding materials to support developers.
4. [ ] **Enhance UI & API:** Implement improvements based on user feedback to refine the interface and extend API functionality ahead of the beta release.

## Conclusion

The project is in an active development phase. Core functionalities have been implemented, but further work is needed on testing, performance, and documentation to ensure a robust and scalable release. The roadmap is set for incremental enhancements towards a stable beta and eventual production release.
