# Delivery Fee System Migration Task List

## Overview

This document outlines the tasks required to migrate the current delivery fee calculation system from a simple Airtable-based logic to a more robust zip code-based system. The new system will support granular fee calculations based on specific zip codes and neighborhoods.

## Reference Data

- Source file: `docs/deliveryzipcodestask.md`
- Contains detailed fee structure for:
  - Brooklyn (20+ zip code zones, fees ranging $8.00-$15.00)
  - Queens (40+ zip code zones, fees ranging $12.00-$18.00)
  - Manhattan (40+ zip code zones, fees ranging $12.00-$25.00)

## Current System

- Simple fee calculation based on boroughs
- Airtable-based configuration
- Free delivery thresholds:
  - Brooklyn: $150 minimum
  - Manhattan: $200 minimum
  - Queens: $150 minimum

  - Free delivery threshold logic
- [x] Perform load testing on zip code lookup functionality
- [x] Test data consistency between old and new system

### 6. Documentation

- [] Update API documentation
- [] Create internal documentation for fee structure maintenance
- [] Document database schema changes
- [] Update customer-facing delivery information
- [] Create troubleshooting guide for customer service team

### 7. Deployment Plan

- [x] Create database backup strategy
- [x] Plan for zero-downtime migration
- [x] Prepare rollback procedure
- [x] Set up monitoring for new endpoints
- [x] Create deployment checklist

### 8. Post-Migration Tasks

- [x] Monitor system performance
- [x] Gather metrics on fee calculation accuracy
- [x] Set up automated alerts for failed calculations
- [x] Plan for periodic fee structure updates
- [x] Archive old fee calculation system

## Success Criteria

1. All zip codes in the provided fee table are properly imported
2. Fee calculations match the provided fee structure
3. Zero downtime during migration
4. All automated tests passing
5. No increase in API response time
6. Successful processing of orders with new fee structure

## Timeline

- Planning & Setup: 1 week
- Development: 2 weeks
- Testing: 1 week
- Documentation: 3 days
- Deployment: 1 day
- Monitoring & Stabilization: 1 week

## Risk Mitigation

1. Maintain parallel systems during initial rollout
2. Implement feature flags for quick rollback
3. Start with a small percentage of traffic
4. Monitor customer feedback and order completion rates
5. Have customer service team ready for support

## Dependencies

- Database migration tools
- Updated API documentation
- ZIP code validation service
- Frontend components for address validation
- Monitoring tools configuration

# Delivery Time Slots and Days Management

## Overview

This section outlines the tasks required to implement a robust delivery time slots and days management system. This will allow for better scheduling and management of deliveries across different zip codes and boroughs.

## Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Updates

- [x] Create delivery_slots table with fields:

  - Slot ID (primary key)
  - Start time (18:00)
  - End time (22:00)
  - Maximum orders
  - Status (active/inactive)
  - Created at
  - Updated at

- [x] Create delivery_days table with fields:

  - Day ID (primary key)
  - Date
  - Status (open/closed)
  - Max slots
  - Notes (for holidays/special days)
  - Created at
  - Updated at

- [x] Create delivery_slot_assignments table with fields:

  - Assignment ID (primary key)
  - Order ID (foreign key)
  - Slot ID (foreign key)
  - Day ID (foreign key)
  - Status (scheduled/completed/cancelled)
  - Created at
  - Updated at

- [x] Create delivery_zip_restrictions table with fields:
  - Restriction ID (primary key)
  - Zip code (foreign key)
  - Day of week (0-6)
  - Slot ID (foreign key)
  - Is available (boolean)
  - Created at
  - Updated at

### 2. API Development
