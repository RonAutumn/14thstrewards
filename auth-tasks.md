# Authentication Tasks & Improvements

## Admin Authentication

### 1. Admin Login Flow
- [ ] Implement dedicated admin login endpoint
- [ ] Add role verification during login
- [ ] Set up proper session management for admin users
- [ ] Implement shorter session timeouts for admin accounts (30 minutes)
- [ ] Add IP-based access restrictions for admin routes

### 2. Admin Session Management
- [ ] Create session tracking system for admin actions
- [ ] Implement session termination after sensitive operations
- [ ] Set up audit logging for all admin activities
- [ ] Add re-authentication requirement for critical operations
- [ ] Implement concurrent session management

### 3. Admin Access Control
- [ ] Set up Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- [ ] Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies for admin data access
- [ ] Create admin-specific API endpoints with proper authorization
- [ ] Add middleware to verify admin permissions

## User Authentication

### 1. Debug Persistent Issues
- [ ] Analyze and log current session management flow
- [ ] Investigate token storage and refresh mechanisms
- [ ] Review session timeout settings
- [ ] Check for race conditions in auth state management
- [ ] Monitor and log auth-related errors

### 2. User Session Improvements
- [ ] Implement proper session refresh mechanism
- [ ] Add session recovery functionality
- [ ] Set up secure token storage
- [ ] Add session invalidation on password change
- [ ] Implement automatic session timeout on inactivity

### 3. Rewards & Checkout Integration
- [ ] Verify auth state persistence during rewards flow
- [ ] Ensure seamless auth during checkout process
- [ ] Add proper error handling for auth failures
- [ ] Implement session recovery during critical transactions
- [ ] Add user-friendly auth state messages

### 4. Security Enhancements
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for auth endpoints
- [ ] Set up secure password reset flow
- [ ] Add proper CORS policies
- [ ] Implement JWT validation on all protected routes
- [ ] Set up secure cookie handling

## Testing & Validation

### 1. Admin Testing
- [ ] Create test suite for admin login flow
- [ ] Test admin session management
- [ ] Validate admin-specific permissions
- [ ] Test audit logging functionality
- [ ] Verify security restrictions

### 2. User Testing
- [ ] Test user authentication flow
- [ ] Validate session persistence
- [ ] Test rewards integration
- [ ] Verify checkout process
- [ ] Test error handling

### 3. Security Testing
- [ ] Perform security audit of auth implementation
- [ ] Test rate limiting functionality
- [ ] Validate token handling
- [ ] Test session timeout behavior
- [ ] Verify proper error logging

## Documentation
